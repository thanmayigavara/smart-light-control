Smart light control

This project demonstrates an IoT-based solution for controlling a tube light using a mobile application. It combines basic hardware and software integration to allow us to switch a tube light ON or OFF remotely through our smartphone.

The core idea behind the project is to provide a simple, wireless method of operating home appliances, starting with a  light. This not only improves convenience but also supports energy efficiency and automation in smart homes.

 How It Works:

The system consists of three main components:

1. Mobile App Interface: A user-friendly application is developed for Android devices. It has buttons that let users send ON/OFF commands.


2. Microcontroller Module: The app communicates wirelessly (typically via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) with a microcontroller (such as an Arduino ), which acts as the control unit.


3. Relay and Tube Light Setup: The microcontroller is connected to a relay module, which physically controls the power supply to the tube light.



When the user taps the ON/OFF button in the mobile app, a signal is sent to the microcontroller, which then triggers the relay to either power on or cut off electricity to the tube light.
